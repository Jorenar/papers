   \begin{abstract}
      C lacks on the front of unified presence that could enhance its visibility
      and community engagement. As we observe efforts in this regard for other
      as old or even older languages~\cite{fortran,forth,cobol}, improvements
      to "branding" of C ought to take place as well.

      This document reminds about the traditional logo of the language,
      mentions colloquial names of the standard revisions, suggests
      presence on code forges, and has PDF attachments with prototypes
      of \texttt{wg14.link} service, as well as a new website that
      would serve as resources hub for both new and seasoned programmers.

\section{Logo}

Traditionally, the logo of C language is uppercase letter 'C' in font Helvetica Black, \\
first used on the cover\footnotemark[1] of the book \textit{The C Programming Language} (K\&R).

\vspace{0.5em}

Usually colored in shades of blue and grey like
\colorbox{HitGrey}{Hit Grey},
\colorbox{CadetGrey}{Cadet Grey},
or
\colorbox{LightSteelBlue}{LightSteelBlue}.

\vspace{2em}

   }
\end{figure}

\vspace{5em}

\begin{aside}
   Beside the traditional logo, various other stylizations of letter C can be found.

   Most noticeable example is a derivative of C++ logo with~"++" removed, and sometimes
   with blue colors either lightened, darkened, or shifted towards violet spectrum.

   \vspace{0.5em}

   While some may prefer it to the traditional one, its usage is not recommended.

   Even if C was lacking an established\footnotemark[3] logo, and acquired
   permission~\cite{cpp} from Standard C++ Foundation to use one based on
   their design, the author(s) of the derivative work are not know. \\
   Another issue rises from existence of similar fan-made creations for different
   languages\footnotemark[4] that are not affiliated with each other, nor have
   particularly much in common beside taking inspiration from C and C++,
   the strongest being the name.
\end{aside}

\footnotetext[1]{\ while the letter 'C' alone is within public
   domain~\cite{wiki:c-logo-public-domain}, the full cover graphic
   might meet threshold of originality for copyright protection;
   in either case, the stylized letter is plenty sufficient, and
   full cover would be "noisy" and harder to fit into iconography}
\footnotetext[2]{\ copy of the file attached to this PDF document as \textattachfile{logo.svg}{logo.svg}}
\footnotetext[3]{\ nota bene, established before C++ (\textit{C with Classes}) was even conceived, let alone its logo}
\footnotetext[4]{\ like for C{-}{-} or C\# (although the latter sometimes has wandered into official communication)}

\section{Colloquial names}
\subsection{Committee}

Official name of the C standardization group is \textit{ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG14},
usually shortened to \textit{WG14}. However, the first standardization effort
was by \textit{X3J1I Technical Committee} under project \textit{381-D} by
\textit{ANSI} on \textit{Computers and Information Processing (X3)}. Before
that was book \textit{The C Programming Language} by Brian Kernighan and
Dennis Ritchie, which is also considered to be an informal standard. And
even before that, Dennis Ritchie and his coworkers were working on C at
the Bell Labs from AT\&T.

\vspace{0.5em}

There is K\&R C, ANSI C, and currently ISO C -- a precedence of change
is established in this matter.

\vspace{0.5em}

Therefore, to best reflect past, present, and whatever the future holds,
it is probably for the better to try using "\textit{C Committee}" whenever
possible, unless precision is required.

\subsection{Standard revisions}

As per the multiple agreements during Committee meetings, as well
as discussions on mailing list, the names of each revision are
\textbf{not} directly derived from the full name of the document
specifying them, nor from the year it was published, nor even
necessarily from they year the work on them was finalized.

\vspace{1em}

As of today (\@date) the list is:

\vspace{0.5em}

\quad \begin{tabular}{|c|l|c|l}
   \cline{1-3}
   \textbf{version} & \textbf{publication} & \textbf{nicknames} \\
   \cline{1-3}

   C2y        &  & &\footnotemark[1] \\
   C23        &  ISO/IEC 9899:2024 & & \\
   C17        &  ISO/IEC 9899:2018 & & \\
   C11        &  ISO/IEC 9899:2011 & & \\
   Embedded C &  ISO/IEC TR 18037:2008 & &\footnotemark[2] \\
   C99        &  ISO/IEC 9899:1999 & & \\
   C95        &  ISO/IEC 9899:1990/Amd 1:1995 & C94 & \\
   C90        &  ISO/IEC 9899:1990 & & \\
   C89        &  ANSI X3.159-1989 & ANSI C & \\
              &  The C Programming Language & K\&R C & \\

   \cline{1-3}
\end{tabular}

\footnotetext[1]{\ future dialect of the standard, currently work in progress}
\footnotetext[2]{\ existence of such official extension to the language can lead to
  curious situation of somebody not aware about this Technical Report overcorrecting
  somebody aware of its existence (although the probability of it is quite low; in
  most cases person talking about "normal" and "embedded" C as if different languages
  is usually the one in the wrong)}

\section{Presence on code forges}

Social network presence become of utter importance in the modern world.
For programming related projects first and foremost important type of SNS
are code forges, nowadays dominated by Git hosting.

\subsection{\href{https://github.com/}{GitHub}}

It's one of the oldest Git repository hosting services right now, as well as the most
popular code forge of today in general. It serves as home to many prominent projects,
from hobbyist to corporate level. While not without its controversies, it is still
the official mirror of many crucial FOSS efforts.

\vspace{0.7em}

Notable examples of organizations from realm of language design present on this platform:
\vspace{-1em}

      \item Zig (\href{https://github.com/ziglang}{ziglang})
   \end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

Due to the platform's popularity, a big issue is finding not claimed profile name.\\
C Committee has at its disposition:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
   \item sc22wg14
   \item c-std-lang
   \item c-lingua
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.7em}

Use-cases:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
   \item hosting of C's homepage\footnote{\ not replacement for Committee's webpage for work}
   \item hosting of \texttt{wg14.link}
   \item public bug tracking
   \item awesome list~\cite{awesome} of C implementations
   \item interaction with users (individuals, organizations, corporates)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\href{https://codeberg.org}{Codeberg}}

Powered by Forgejo\footnote{\ a fork of Gitea}, Codeberg is a non-profit Git hosting
for FOSS projects, gaining the popularity recently. There are some convenient ways
to mirror~\cite{codeberg-mirror} repositories from and to other hosting services.
While the C standard does not meet the criteria of a FOSS project, there should not
be an issue to host on this platform adjacent repositories that do meet requirements.

\subsection{\href{https://gitlab.com/}{GitLab}}

The Committee has a \href{https://gitlab.gwdg.de/iso-c/}{group} on GitLab instance
maintained by \textit{Society for scientific data processing mbH G√∂ttingen} (GWDG).
It aids in developing the standard itself, as well as other internal projects, and
could be useful for projects meant to read-only by general public.

\subsection{Other forges}

Two other online forges worth having eye on include
\href{https://sourceforge.net/}{SourceForge}
and \href{https://sr.ht/}{sourcehut}.

\clearpage

\section{Internet domains}

Similarly to GitHub profile names, lot of sensible domain names have already been claimed.
Fortunately not all of them -- some of unique ones still remain open, and it is know that
some of the reservations were made by the Committee members. It should be discussed which
ones and for what purposes to use them.

\section{wg14.link}

WG21 offers an convenient URL shortening service for accessing their documents.~\cite{wg21link}

\vspace{1em}

Thanks to not overcomplicated structure of the
\href{https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/}{WG14 website},
scrapping it is not only possible, but fairly simple on the
client side with a bit of JavaScript code.
Attachment \textattachfile{wg14link.html}{wg14link.html}
holds a~prototype of such solution.
After opening the HTML file\footnote{\ redirections linked in this document will not
work until after the deployment of the \texttt{wg14.link} online} in a web browser
the following self-explanatory view should appear:

\vspace{2em}

\begin{adjustwidth}{1em}{}
   \fontfamily{cmr}\selectfont
   {\Large wg14.link} \\

   Example redirections:\\
   \begin{adjustwidth}{1em}{}
      \begin{tabular}{ll}
         \href{http://wg14.link}{wg14.link} & WG14 website {\scriptsize (this redirection currently disabled)} \\
         \href{http://wg14.link?}{wg14.link?} & this page \\
         \href{http://wg14.link?draft}{wg14.link?draft} & latest working draft \\
         \href{http://wg14.link?c11}{wg14.link?c11} & final public draft of C11 \\
         \href{http://wg14.link?n3408}{wg14.link?n3408} & document N3408 \\
         \href{http://wg14.link?msg27143}{wg14.link?msg27143} & reflector message 27143 \\
      \end{tabular}
   \end{adjustwidth}
\end{adjustwidth}

\vspace{2em}

Such file can be served statically via GitHub pages, for example.

\clearpage

\section{Homepage}

The Committee's website on open-std.org serves its purpose, C lacks
an approachable front-page for people outside the working group.
Attachment \textattachfile{homepage.html}{homepage.html} holds
a proposition of one:\\
A simple HTML5 document, with CSS tricks to make it appear multi-page, plus negligible
amount of JavaScript to update the window title for each "sub-page"; serves both light
and dark theme, as well as adapts to size of mobile devices. Depending on where and how
it would be deployed, it could be split for maintainability and reassembled e.g.\ with
Jekyll static site generator.
